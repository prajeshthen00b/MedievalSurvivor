# Medieval Survivor
A simple text-based, turn-based combat game written in python 3. The player is allocated a random 'hero' of predefined stats and is pitted against another hero. The hero whose HP (Health) touches or drops below 0 FIRST loses the match. If both heroes have a positive health by the end of 5 rounds, the match is rendered a stalemate.
